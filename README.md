## üìú Description

Audio Transcriber is a tool that allows users to upload audio files via a custom API platform. The backend processes the audio files, converting them to WAV format, and then performs a transcription in text form. Users can select different language models for precise transcriptions, and the transcribed text is further processed by a language model (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate an accurate summary. Both the transcribed text and the summary are provided via the API.
